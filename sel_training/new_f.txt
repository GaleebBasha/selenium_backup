RRR is an upcoming Indian Telugu-language period action drama film directed by S. S. Rajamouli, and produced by D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainments. 
The film stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt and Olivia Morris while Samuthirakani, 
Alison Doody, Ray Stevenson and Shriya Saran play supporting roles. 
It is a fictional story about two Indian revolutionaries,
 Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Rama Rao), 
who fought against the British Raj and Nizam of Hyderabad respectively.

Rajamouli scripted the film from the original story written by K. V. Vijayendra Prasad. 
Rajamouli came across reading stories about the incidents happened in the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem, and 
connected the coincidence between them. The thought that how they could have been friends during their formative 
years inspired Rajamouli to make the film. Set in 1920, the plot explores the undocumented period in their lives
 when both the revolutionaries choose to go into oblivion before they began the fight for their country.
